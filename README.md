I currently work in data consulting, where I have developed a love for programming in Clojure. My background ranges from engineering design to data analysis to project management. I have worked with various BI tools such as Tableau, Sisense, and Periscope and have also developed my own tools to automate ETL processes.

My career began with designing refinery equipment, then moved over to data analytics & BI. I enjoyed the programming aspects of my work, because of the puzzle-solving nature of it (I really love solving complex problems). When I came upon Clojure, I recognized its elegance and suitability for my work. I took on the challenge of learning it, and have been making use of it since then.
